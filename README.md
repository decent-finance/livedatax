A set of extension functions which can be used to apply transformations to your LiveData to make it look like you are using RxJava.

## Example
```kotlin
MutableLiveData<Int>()
    .filter { it > 10 }
    .map { it + 10 }
    .switchMap { MutableLiveData(it.toString()) }
```

## Installation
Add the following repository to your top-level `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {	url 'https://dl.bintray.com/decent-finance/utils' }
    }
}
```

Add the following dependency to your module-level `buld.gradle`
```groovy
implementation "com.cexdirect:livedatax:$someVersion"
```
